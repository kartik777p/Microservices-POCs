Limitations of proxy based mocking (Easy Mock)
1) we can not perform testing on static method of target class
2) we can not perform testing on private method of target class
3) we can not perform testing on final method of target class
4) we can not test final classes
NOTE :-
   To solve all this problem it is recomanded to use Power MOCK
   (byte code manipulation based  mocking)
